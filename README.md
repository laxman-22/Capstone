### Computer Engineering Capstone Project

This repository contains the code for an Android application used in the Wearable Health Monitoring System.

Below is a High-Level Design diagram of how this system operates in order to allow for this system to work successfully:

For more information on the background, purpose, and goal of this project, the following image shows the poster presented at Carleton University to demonstrate the solution:

and [here](https://github.com/laxman-22/Capstone/blob/master/Reports/Final%20Report_Group%2030.pdf) is the Final Report that was created to document the team's whole design and implementation process

If you want to run this code, the "Reports" and "images" directories would have to be removed and then you can use Android studio to compile the application
